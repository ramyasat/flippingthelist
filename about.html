                        <p class="text-white-50"> In the summer of 2020, partners from the <a href="https://twitter.com/ASEHGradCaucus">ASEH Grad Caucus</a>, <a href:"https://envhistnow.com/">Environmental History Now</a>, <a href="https://niche-canada.org/research/new-scholars/">NiCHE New Scholars </a>, and the <a href="https://www.envhistwomen.com/">Women’s Environmental History Network</a> launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlipTheList">#FlipTheList</a> initiative. Our goal was simple: to update and enrich the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_books">“List of environmental books”</a> on Wikipedia to reflect the diverse and multi-layered nature of environmental scholarship, highlighting works by scholars of color, scholars from the Global South, and/or scholars who identify as women, trans and non-binary people. By focusing our efforts on revolutionizing this one particular list of environment books on one of the most visited websites on the internet, we hoped to make<a href="https://envhistnow.com/category/flipthelist/">a small yet significant impact</a>.
                           <br>                      
It all started with a Tweet. In May 2020 Sara Pritchard quickly consulted Wikipedia’s list of environmental books and was disheartened by the demographic representation. She wrote: “We need a Wikipedia edit-a-thon. Like, yesterday.” Indeed, even a cursory glance at the article on Wikipedia reveals a striking imbalance in the works that are represented: an <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraBPritchard/status/1266051377295474695">overwhelming bias</a> towards white, male authors. We need to listen to Black community members and heed calls to <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/">#ShutDownAcademia</a> in order to move from intent to action in addressing systemic racism. We also want to build on the ongoing work of the <a href="https://thesyllabusproject.weebly.com/">Syllabus Project</a>, which has encouraged environmental historians to diversify their course syllabi by including more scholarship by women and people of color. It’s clear we need to update and enrich this woefully inadequate list of resources on Wikipedia so it brings the diverse and multi-layered nature of environmental-related work and expertise to the forefront—not only for academics, but especially the general public.
                            <br>
So, responding to Sara’s call to “Flip the List,” an <a href="https://envhistnow.com/2020/06/15/flipthelist-call-for-participants/">edit-a-thon</a> took place on June 23, 2020, supported by the ASEH’s <a href="https://aseh.org/Committee-on-Diversity-Inclusion-and-Equity"> Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity</a>. More than 100 people came together and crowdsourced a list of over 800 entries, far exceeding the initial goal of 300 recommendations. Since that day, many volunteers have helped to add these entries to the Wikipedia page, and this work has been ongoing.
Since that beginning, the work of FlipTheList has expanded in small but impactful ways. We learned that in order to be included as entries on a book list, books need to have their own dedicated Wikipedia articles. This has led to the writing of dozens of new Wikipedia articles highlighting the environmental scholarship of people of diverse backgrounds, and links between those articles and related topics.
We continue to envision more ways of expanding this work. One exciting possibility is getting more students involved in “Flipping the List” through coursework—a way to bring student research and expertise to the broader community while continuing the work of enriching the representation of environmental resources. We are also always open to listening to ideas from new partners.
